- Expose to HTML & CSS in primary school
- Expose to Visual Basic in secondary school
  - The teacher didn't really teach much, we are told
    to just copy the code from the notes the teacher
    gave us and run it. Without knowing what does those code
    means.
- Expose to HTML, CSS, SQL and Php in college
  - The teacher, just gave us notes on SQL and PHP syntax.
      - I don't even have any idea how to use PHP to let my HTML
        to get data from SQL.
  - It didn't really teach us much other than told us to look
  up ourselves.
  - Using W3school last time. Resource is not that superb like
  today. Or I still didn't know how to google search the
  resouce I need.

    files

  - Expose to Ruby on Rails in code academy. Since I always wanted
    to know how to create a dynamic application, those with database
    and business logic.
  - Go through it in Codeacademy, but totally have no idea what's
  happening because I have very limited knowledge and mental model
  about how the internet works or how client server works.
  - Go back to learn Ruby in Codeacademy.
- Learn `processing.js` in Khan Academy. Experience with conditional
and repetition statement there.
  - I still don't know how a for loops work.
  - I just kind of figuring out the pattern.
- Found Learn Ruby the Hard way and go through it.
- Expose to Rails Tutorial and work on it.
  - I still face a lot of errors even though I am following
    the books.
  - Still have hardship to understand association, database modeling.
